Usergrid-Backbone-Sample
========================

A brief sample to illustrate how to get up and running with Usergrid, Backbone.js, and JQuery Mobile.

Please note that in this simple example, we are using client_id and client_secret as the authentication method.
This is fine for server-side applications, but for distributed apps, this method is not secure.

For any distributed application including HTML5 apps, the proper method is to login using
the management api using a username and password.
